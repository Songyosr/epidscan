\title{Coerce Data to SaTScan Network Table}
\usage{
ss_nwk(data, loc_id, neighbor_id, distance = NULL, distance_units = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing network edges.}

\item{loc_id}{Column name for the source location ID.}

\item{neighbor_id}{Column name for the connected neighbor ID.}

\item{distance}{Optional column name for distance/weight for the connection.}

\item{distance_units}{Units for distance (optional string).}
}
\value{
An \code{ss_tbl} object of type "nwk".
}
\description{
Creates an \code{ss_tbl} object of type \code{"nwk"} (SaTScan Network File).
A network file defines adjacency between locations as an edge list,
optionally with a distance or weight for each connection. SaTScan can use
this structure to define cluster expansion on a network (rather than by
Euclidean distance), making it suitable for road networks or other
connectivity-based proximity.

This constructor records which columns define the source location, the
neighbor location, and the optional distance/weight. It does not compute
distances or alter the network; those decisions are deferred to SaTScan
and the analysis configuration.
}
\section{SaTScan File Specification}{

The Network File has the following structure:
\code{<LocationID> <NeighborID> <Distance>}

\itemize{
\item \strong{LocationID}: Identifier for the source location.
\item \strong{NeighborID}: Identifier for the connected neighbor location.
\item \strong{Distance}: Optional. Numeric distance or weight between the two locations.
