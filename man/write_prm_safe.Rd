\description{
`r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`

Writes SaTScan parameters to a file, ensuring that required section headers
(e.g. `[Input]`, `[Analysis]`) are present. This guards against issues where
internal defaults might be missing headers.
}
\details{
This function is deprecated. Use \code{\link{prm_write}()} instead, which
uses skeleton injection for more robust PRM file generation.
