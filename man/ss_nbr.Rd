\usage{
ss_nbr(data, loc_id, neighbor_cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing neighbor lists.}

\item{loc_id}{Column name for the location ID.}

\item{neighbor_cols}{Character vector of column names representing neighbors.}
}
\value{
An \code{ss_tbl} object of type "nbr".

\description{
Creates an \code{ss_tbl} object of type \code{"nbr"} (SaTScan Non-Euclidean Neighbors File).
A neighbors file defines, for each centroid location, an ordered list of
neighboring locations ranked by closeness. SaTScan constructs candidate
clusters by progressively expanding each row (centroid, then centroid + first
neighbor, then + second neighbor, etc.) until the row ends.

This constructor expects neighbors in a wide format (one row per centroid,
multiple neighbor columns in rank order). It preserves the input data and
records \code{neighbor_cols} so the writer can emit the correct SaTScan ASCII
structure without reshaping user data.
}
\section{SaTScan File Specification}{

The Neighbors File has the following structure:
\code{<LocationID> <Neighbor1ID> <Neighbor2ID> ...}

\itemize{
\item \strong{LocationID}: Identifier for the location.
\item \strong{NeighborIDs}: One or more columns, each representing a neighbor of the \code{LocationID}.
The order of these columns matters for SaTScan's interpretation of neighbor hierarchy.
