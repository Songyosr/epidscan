\usage{
ss_met(data, meta_loc_id, member_cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing meta-location definitions.}

\item{meta_loc_id}{Column name for the meta-location ID.}

\item{member_cols}{Character vector of column names representing member locations.}
}
\value{
An \code{ss_tbl} object of type "met".
}
\description{
Creates an \code{ss_tbl} object of type \code{"met"} (SaTScan Meta Locations File).
A meta locations file defines groupings of multiple locations into a single
meta-location (e.g., aggregating tracts into counties). SaTScan uses these
groupings to treat members as belonging to the same higher-level unit when
a meta-location analysis is requested.

This constructor expects a wide representation (one row per meta-location,
with one or more member columns). It preserves the input data and records
\code{member_cols} so the writer can output the correct SaTScan ASCII format.
}
\section{SaTScan File Specification}{

The Meta Locations File has the following structure:
\code{<MetaLocationID> <Member1ID> <Member2ID> ...}

\itemize{
\item \strong{MetaLocationID}: Identifier for the meta-location (e.g., a county).
\item \strong{MemberIDs}: One or more columns, each representing a member location (e.g., a census tract)
that belongs to the \code{MetaLocationID}.
}
